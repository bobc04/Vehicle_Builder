- AS a developer
- I WANT to update an existing application to include additional vehicle types
- SO THAT I am able to comprehend and work with existing code bases.

- THEN I can perform actions with that vehicle
- WHEN I perform an action with a vehicle
- THEN I see the result of the action in the command-line

### Installation and Running the Application
1. Ensure Node.js is installed on the local system: https://nodejs.org/en
2. Clone this repo: 'git clone https://github.com/bobc04/Vehicle_Builder.git' (without quotes)
3. In VS Code integrated terminal, native terminal, or other IDE, navigate to the SRC directory
4. Run 'npm install'
5. Run 'npm run start', these commands will assist with transpiling the application from TypeScript to JavaScript
6. Application should run and prompt user to select and enter details for creating a vehicle or select and existing one
7. Follow the prompts
8. Next, navigate to the 'dist' directory, and locate the 'index.js'
9. Run the application again, this time using Node, with 'node index.js'
10. Note the application runs in Node using JavaScript with one command as opposed to running 'npm install' and npm run start' with TypeScript
